==================================
Games that contain race conditions
==================================

Virtua Fighter
  The game stores a matrix stack pointer at 0x60435E8, which points to the stack starting at 0x6042FE8 where each matrix
  takes 0x30 bytes. The pointer and the stack are read and written by both SH-2 CPUs simultaneously.

  The master CPU runs a routine at 0x60279AC that clears the cache address array (6xxxxxxx), requests the slave CPU to
  run its routine, then proceeds with vector/matrix calculations using the matrix stack pointer.

  The slave CPU routine at 0x601B11C clears the cache address array, overwrites the matrix at the top of the stack then
  does vector/matrix math with the same pointer as above.

  The routines make no attempt to synchronize execution between them.

  The two CPUs compete for the stack and the pointer, which is incremented or decremented in steps of 0x30. Because the
  game stores VDP2 parameters before the matrix stack, NBGs get corrupted when the pointer decrements past 0x6042FE8,
  breaking the UI and background. If the pointer increments past 0x60435E8, the pointer gets corrupted and the game
  attempts to read from random areas, usually resulting in a Ring Out for player 1, some serious 3D graphics distortion
  or everything disappearing.
