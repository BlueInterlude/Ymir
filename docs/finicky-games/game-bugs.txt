Panzer Dragoon 2 Zwei
---------------------
  Sound corruption during boot up with save data on both System and Cartridge Memory
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  During startup, the game plays an intro video followed by the splash screen.
  If you have a save file in both the system and cartridge memories, the game displays a memory select screen before everything else.

  The game uses a routine to load sound data into sound WRAM for each episode that checks which sound bank has been loaded to avoid reloading the same bank repeatedly.
  The portion of memory where the sound bank is loaded is shared with the video playback routine.
  When you only have one save file, everything works fine: the video plays, then the game loads the sound bank for Episode 1, then it goes to the splash screen.
  When there are two save files, the game loads the bank for Episode 1 to handle sounds in the memory select screen.
  This happens *before* the intro video, which trashes part of the loaded sound bank.
  The routine still thinks the Episode 1 bank is loaded correctly, so when it reaches the splash screen, it doesn't reload the bank.
  When you go to Options and try to play the Episode 1 music, some of the samples are corrupted (notably the cymbal).
  The sound bank gets fixed when you play any other Episode music then go back to Episode 1.
