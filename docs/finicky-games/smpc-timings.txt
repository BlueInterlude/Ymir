Games that require SMPC commands to be delayed
==============================================

Running SMPC commmands instantaneously cause issues with these games:

Akumajou Dracula X
Virtual Hydlide
  Gets stuck on the SEGA logo screen if INTBACK executes instantly

Soukyuu Gurentai
  Doesn't respond to controller inputs if INTBACK executes instantly

===========================================================
Games that require INTBACK peripheral reports to be delayed
===========================================================

Virtua Racing
  Requests an INTBACK 01 08 F0 -> include status and peripheral reports without peripheral data collection timing optimization
  Once the INTBACK interrupt is handled, sends a continue request
  Expects the status report to be delivered before VBlank OUT and peripheral reports to happen a bit after VBlank OUT
  The SMPC interrupt handler copies OREG data to a buffer and updates write pointer/counter
  The VBlank OUT interrupt handler resets the write pointer/counter
  Fails to respond to inputs otherwise
