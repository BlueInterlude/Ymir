Akumajou Dracula X
------------------
  Bad order of operations when saving games
  -----------------------------------------
  The game has a buffer for save data at 60485c0 with 4388 (0x1124) bytes.
  When saving games, it calls one of the following functions:
  - 600d370: Alucard save
  - 600d264: Maria/Richter(unconfirmed) save
  Both functions eventually call the function at 600cb74 which calculates the checksum of the save data starting from
  60485c4 then write the result at 60485c0 (the beginning of the save data buffer). Immediately after that, they set
  the save file's date/time BUP_SetDate using the RTC time (a copy of which is stored at 6057f60) and promptly write
  the converted value *into the buffer that was just checksummed*!
  
  Luckily, the game calls the save function twice in a row, so the checksum is updated with the new date/time and, as
  long as the RTC clock doesn't increment the minute in between the two consecutive saves, the problem is fixed.
