=========================================================
Games that are sensitive to VDP1 and video signal timings
=========================================================

Panzer Dragoon 1 (in-game)
  Frame 1:
    [VBlank IN]  VBE=1 -- expects the erase to happen at this line's HBlank IN
    [VBlank OUT] VBE=0 FCM=1 FCT=1 -- expects the swap to happen at this line's HBlank IN (halfway through)
  Frame 2: nothing
  Frame 3: nothing

If you don't delay VBE and FCM/FCT handling until HBlank, you get flashing VDP1 graphics due to swapping frames too late or erasing frames too early.

Sonic R (during title screen, menus and in-game)
  Frame 1:
    [VBlank IN]  VBE=1 -- expects the erase to happen at this line's HBlank IN
    [VBlank OUT] VBE=0 FCM=1 FCT=1 PTM=1 -- expects the swap to happen at this line's HBlank IN (halfway through)
  Frame 2: nothing

If you don't delay VBE and FCM/FCT handling until HBlank, you get unsorted, overlapping or flashing polygons.

-----

Virtua Fighter 1 (in-game)
  Always uses VBE=0
  Frame 1:
    [VBlank IN] FCM=1 FCT=0 -- sets manual framebuffer erase, held until next framebuffer swap
  Frame 2:
    [VBlank IN] FCM=1 FCT=1 -- does manual erase then swap

The manual framebuffer erase flag is *not* handled at VBlank IN HBlank IN. It is handled just before the next framebuffer swap.

Context
=======

Relevant VDP1 registers:
  VBE=0 disables VBlank Erase mode. VBE=1 enables it.

  FCM=0 FCT=0 is 1-cycle mode - framebuffer erase happens at every VBlank IN HBlank IN and framebuffer swap happens halfway through HBlank on every VBlank OUT.
  Presumably FCM=0 FCT=1 works the same.

  PTM defines VDP1 rendering triggers:
    0 = never
    1 = immediately upon writing this value (but only if changed from something else)
    2 = on framebuffer swap

  Manual erase is set when writing FCM=1 FCT=0 to FBCR.
  Manual swap is set when writing FCM=1 FCT=1 to FBCR.

  Manual erase is handled before the next swap.

Relevant video signal events:
  VBlank IN
    Happens at the start of the first scanline past the display area (aka the first bottom border line)
    Triggers the VBlank IN interrupt on the SCU
      Most games use this to set up FCM, FCT, sometimes VBE and PTM
  VBlank OUT
    Happens at the start of the last scanline (at least in this emulator)
    Triggers the VBlank OUT interrupt on the SCU
      Some games use this to set VBE=0 and manually start VDP1 rendering with PTM=1
      Some games also use this to set FCM=1 FCT=1 to immediately swap framebuffers
  HBlank IN during first line of VBlank IN
    Triggers the HBlank IN interrupt on the SCU (as does HBlank IN on any other line)
    Triggers VDP1 framebuffer erase if FCM=0 (1-cycle mode) or VBE=1 (VBlank Erase)
    Does not respond to manual framebuffer erase, nor does it clear the flag
  Halfway through HBlank during VBlank OUT
    Stops framebuffer erase if in progress
    Triggers VDP1 framebuffer swap if FCM=0 FCT=0 (1-cycle mode) or a manual swap was requested
      Clears the manual swap flag
      Also triggers the manual framebuffer erase if requested just before the swap, and clears the manual erase flag
